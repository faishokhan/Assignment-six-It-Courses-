        <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling the sharing of documents and other web resources, such as images, videos, and applications. Web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which are strings of characters that identify a resource on the Web.
            The World Wide Web has had a profound impact on our lives. It has changed the way we access information, communicate with each other, and do business. The Web is a constantly evolving platform, and it is clear that it will continue to play an important role in our lives for many years to come.</p>
